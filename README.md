##What data will your variables represent and what will they be called?


- var distance---> determines random distance inside this.run=funtion() inside var Mascot function
- var Smaller---> determines the two smallest values
- var Smallest---> determines the smallest value
- var raceDistance ---> the given variable length of the race (20 meters)
- var lowest---->funtion that determines if there is a winner (or tie) by comparing var race=function()



##What objects will you need to create?
- var mascot1 = new Mascot("Pete", "Potato", 4);
- var mascot2 = new Mascot("Benny", "Blueberry", 4);
- var mascot3 = new Mascot("Harry", "Hamburger", 4);

note: mascot1, mascot2, and mascot3 all need to be created and hold values for this.name, this.food, this.endurance, and this.run

##What functions will you need to create?
- var race---->function that compares the variable racedistance, to mascot1, to mascot2, to mascot3

##Who will be responsible for which section of code, or will you all be writing each section together?
- We decided to all approach the problem individually for 15 minutes and then compare our ideas. 

##Most importantly, what kind of food items are best for racing against each other?
- Pete the Potato won our race!
